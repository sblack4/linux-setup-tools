# linux-setup-tools
Quickly customize your Linux environment so you can get to work


## Getting Started

Get your dotfiles, install your packages, and bootstrap your 
linux server with three commands. 

```sh
curl -O http://sblack4.github.io/linux-setup-tools/setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
or get fancy and shorten that url (try [goo.gl/](https://goo.gl/))
```sh
curl -L goo.gl/7gHfnq -o setup.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
